Description : Battleship game - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

This Battleship game has a flixable grid size. An example of a grid size is 10 x 10 
where the top left corner position is (1,1), left bottom is (1,10) and right
bottom is (10,10).  The coordinate is represented by a tuple of Int not Int and Char.
Fist Int is "i" or row and the other Int is "j" which is column number. 

The primary grid is your side while the target grid represents
your opponent's primary grid.  You may place a number of ships into the primary
grid only.
